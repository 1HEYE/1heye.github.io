<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an undergraduate student in Economics at Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I will participate in an exchange program at Bocconi University starting in August 2025 and am currently applying to Economics PhD programs.

My research interests lie in environmental, development, and agricultural economics. My recent work includes:
(1) Empirical analysis of climate-change effects on land rental markets;
(2) Investigating how AI policies impact labor markets.
